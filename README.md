# PillReminder
Timer without a clock display and used to indicate when x hours have elapsed since reset. The time milestones elapsed are indicated by a blinking LED. I use to to remember when to take medication after 24 hours.

These are the timer milestones:
SIX_HOURS = 6 * ONE_HOUR; 
TWELVE_HOURS = 12 * ONE_HOUR; 
TWENTY_HOURS = 20 * ONE_HOUR;
